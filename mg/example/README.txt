I assume that you have  fully working dev environment on your PC (WAMP, LAMP, Zend Server CE)
with MySql and PHP 5 and Zend Framework is in your include path.

Use MySql Workbench to open mg_test.mvb file. Then select: 
"database -> forward enginieer -> [next] -> [next] -> [next] ->"

Workbench will create for you a mg_test database along with all tables I prepared to test MG script.
