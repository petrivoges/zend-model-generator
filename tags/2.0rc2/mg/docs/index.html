<h1>Jack's Model Generator</h1>

<em>Thank you for using my model generator. I hope it will save you hours of work, as it did for me - Jack.</em>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
	<li>PHP 5</li>
	<li>Zend Framework</li>
	<li>MySql</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works ?</h2>

<p>ModelGenerator analyzes your database looking for relations and keys - primary and unique.
Remember that each table MUST have PRIMARY key defined. Generator will not work without it. It's a good practice so
remember to add at least "auto_increment" column in your tables.
</p>

<h2>How models work ?</h2>

<p>Generator will create 4 files for each table. An empty class - model, base model, table model and table base.
The first one - model, is a file where you can write your own code. It will not be modified nor removed
even if you will run Generator more than once.
<br>
<br>
Base model - this file contains automatically generated code, along with some documentation
helping you php editor in auto-completing your code. There are also very helpfull methods like 
find*Parent*, find*childTable*, create*Child*, delete*child*.

Remember that you are NOT allowed to edit this file, as it will change as soon as you will 
try to re-generate your code. The code will be replaced and all changes will be lost.
<br>
<br>

Table model is very similar to model. It's a file where you can put some of your hand-written code.
<br>
<br>

Table base was made for the same purpose as the base model - it's auto-generated and all 
changes made to this file will be lost as soon as you'll lunch the Generator.
